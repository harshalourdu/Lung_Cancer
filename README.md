- Dataset Description:

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, presenting significant challenges in early detection and effective treatment. To aid in the global effort to understand and combat this disease, we are excited to introduce our comprehensive Lung Cancer Dataset.


- Working:

- We have selected **10 of the following classification algorithms** that have been used in this project:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Naive Bayes
6. Random Forest
7. Gradient Boosting
8. Neural Networks
9. AdaBoost
10. XGBoost

- Then we build the model for each of the above mentioned algorithms. Using the following **Evaluation Metrics** we have compared the algorithms:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. F1 Score
4. Recall Score
5. Confusion Matrix

- These are the accuracies of the algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression: **90.29%**
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): **87.37%**
3. Decision Tree: **87.37%**
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM): **84.46%**
5. Naive Bayes: **86.4%**
6. Random Forest: **89.32%**
7. Gradient Boosting: **89.32%**
8. Neural Networks: **84.46%**
9. AdaBoost: **84.46%**
10. XGBoost: **84.46%**
